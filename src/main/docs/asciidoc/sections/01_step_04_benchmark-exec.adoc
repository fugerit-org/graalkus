[#step-04-benchmark-exec]
=== Benchmark application

In this step we are going to benchmark the application, both in JIT and AOT version.

==== Requirements

For this benchmark we will use a script that can be found in the folder link:https://github.com/fugerit-org/graalkus/blob/develop/src/main/script/bench-graph-h2-load.sh[bench-graph-h2-load.sh], it is possible to find it in the following path of the repository _src/main/script/bench-graph-h2-load.sh_.

The script needs :

* link:https://github.com/JoeDog/siege[siege], for actual benchmark
* link:https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord[psrecord], to plot resources usage

==== Benchmark JIT application

Build the application

[source,shell]
----
mvn package
----

Run the script (will also launch the application)

[source,shell]
----
./src/main/script/bench-graph-siege.sh -m JIT
----

==== Benchmark AOT application

Build the application

[source,shell]
----
mvn install -Dnative
----

Run the script (will also launch the application)

[source,shell]
----
./src/main/script/bench-graph-siege.sh -m AOT
----

[#step-04-benchmark-exec-sample-output]
==== Sample output

Here I will show, as an example, the result on my system.

* OS : Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
* CPU : AMD Ryzen 7 3700X (8 core, 16 thread)
* Memory : 32 GB

With standard script parameters (h2load) :

* 50000 requests for warm up run (w)
* 250000 requests for benchmark run (r)
* 12 clients (c)
* 1 threads (t)

JIT result :

[source,json]
----
{
    "transactions":			      333324,
	"availability":			      100.00,
	"elapsed_time":			       25.92,
	"data_transferred":		      404.11,
	"response_time":		        0.00,
	"transaction_rate":		    12859.72,
	"throughput":			       15.59,
	"concurrency":			       11.31,
	"successful_transactions":	      333324,
	"failed_transactions":		           0,
	"longest_transaction":		        0.07,
	"shortest_transaction":		        0.00
}

AOT result :

[source,json]
----
{
    "transactions":			      333324,
	"availability":			      100.00,
	"elapsed_time":			       34.78,
	"data_transferred":		      404.11,
	"response_time":		        0.00,
	"transaction_rate":		     9583.78,
	"throughput":			       11.62,
	"concurrency":			       11.43,
	"successful_transactions":	      333324,
	"failed_transactions":		           0,
	"longest_transaction":		        0.13,
	"shortest_transaction":		        0.00
}

And the relative resource plotting :

[.left]
.AOT Benchmark plotting

--

As you can see :

* The rate is more or less the same for JIT and AOT version
* All request are successful in both scenarios
* CPU footprint is also comparable (Except at startup where AOT performs better)
* AOT memory footprint is 3x times lower than JIT version

NOTE: Keep in mind we did not add any optimization to JIT version (for instance link:https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/crac[CRaC]), nor to AOT one (i.e. link:https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/PGO/[PGO]).

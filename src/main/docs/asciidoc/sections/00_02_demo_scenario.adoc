=== Demo scenario

This demo is inspired by a real microservice I configured for AOT some time ago.

The scenario we take in consideration is a JIT application used generate documents in various formats (HTML, MarkDown, AsciiDoc and PDF), through rest services.

Let's define every format as a feature, and the load is roughly this :

. HTML : 40%
. MarkDown : 30%
. AsciiDoc : 20%
. PDF : 10%

We will find out that PDF conversion it is not easy to implement.

So we will use the xref:#mixed-approach[mixed approach], converting formats 1, 2, 3 only. So at the end the AOT Application will handle the 90% of the load, whereas the JIT Application will be left with only 10%.

We can use an API gateway or some other technology to keep usage transparent for clients.

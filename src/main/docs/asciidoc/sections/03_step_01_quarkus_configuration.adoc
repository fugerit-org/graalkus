[#step-01-quarkus-configuration]
=== Graalkus configuration

We need to install the link:https://quarkus.io/guides/smallrye-health[SmallRye Health] extension :

[source,shell]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions='smallrye-health'
----

NOTE: this extension is needed to provide health check.

We are not using the built-in link:https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-openshift[OpenShift] extension, but it is possible to install it as well :

There is a built-in Quarkus extension which make openshift deployment easy.

Let's install the
[source,shell]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions='quarkus-openshift
----

And configure the route exposure :

[source,yaml]
----
quarkus:
  openshift:
    route:
      expose: true
----

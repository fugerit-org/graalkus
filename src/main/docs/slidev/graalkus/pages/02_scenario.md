# Application demo scenario

This demo is inspired by a real microservice I migrated to AOT some time ago.

The scenario for this project is a JIT application used generate documents in various formats (HTML, MarkDown, AsciiDoc and PDF), exposed as REST services.

Let's define every format as a feature, and the use of each format/feature : 

- HTML : 40% 
- MarkDown : 30%
- AsciiDoc : 20%
- PDF : 10%
